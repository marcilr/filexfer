\subsection{Job Scheduling}
Jobs are scheduled using a web interface at
\texttt{nms.operations.gci.com/relevance}.  Navigate to the
``FileXfer'' application and click the ``File Transfer Jobs'' link.
Job execution happens on \texttt{prod-prov4-cdr1.operations.gci.com}.
A \texttt{cron} job executes every minute from
\texttt{/etc/cron.d/filexfer} to kick off the various \texttt{filexfer}
scripts.\footnote{\href{http://oss-wiki.operations.gci.com/dev/index.php/Usage\_Collection\_Framework\_(filexfer)}{Usage
    Collection Framework (filexfer)}}
