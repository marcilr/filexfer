There is a FileXfer GUI app on Relevance that can be used to
create/delete/update transfer/load jobs and monitors, and view
logs and errors.  It is available on both presenter 4 on
presenter 1 (but at this time it is safer to use presenter 4 to
update jobs). Also the lab presenter (lab-presenter4) is
currently pointed at the production ACS FileXfer
instance.\footnote{FileXfer.txt:149, GCI Network Services,
