\subsubsection{File Transfer Logging}
Every file transfer is recorded in a database table. There are
two reasons for this table: first, it tells \texttt{filexfer}
hich files have already been transferred, and second, it
provides an audit trail for SOX compliance. The table is
\texttt{filexfer.logs} on
\texttt{sadc-cdr-mysql1.operations.gci.com}. Use the
\texttt{filexfer.joblogs} view to easily find logs by job name
or network element ID.\\
\\
File transfer logs may also be viewed in the
'\texttt{Logs \& Errors}' page of the web
interface.\footnote{\href{http://oss-wiki.operations.gci.com/dev/index.php/Usage\_Collection\_Framework\_(filexfer)}{Usage
