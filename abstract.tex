\begin{abstract}
  \noindent The FileXfer application is a system for automated file transfer
  jobs for copying files.  ``There are 3 applications that make up the usage
  collection framework: \texttt{filexfer}, which does the actual file
  transfers; \texttt{filexfer-jobmonitor}, which is configured
  to monitor various aspects of jobs and create NMS alarms when necessary; and
  \texttt{filexfer-}\\
  \texttt{dataloader}, which bulk-loads file data into database
  tables. There are also housekeeping scripts called
  \texttt{filexfer-filearchive}, which keeps files in the data directory
  pruned and compressed, and \texttt{filexfer-fileunarchive}, which allows
  files to be pulled out of the archive so filexfer jobs can work with them
  again.''\footnote{\href{http://oss-wiki.operations.gci.com/dev/index.php/Usage\_Collection\_Framework\_(filexfer)}{Usage Collection Framework (filexfer)}}
