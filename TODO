+++ Thu Jun 30 16:40:21 AKDT 2016 - Wrap source code in Appendix.

+++ Tue Jun 28 13:05:21 AKDT 2016 - Add footer to every page with:
Created from filexfer.tex by Raymond E. Marcil - July 1, 2016

Solid progress. Still need to merge orginal creation data.


+++ Tue Jun 28 09:12:16 AKDT 2016 - The title page and header/footer still
needs more work.

o The 7-characters of SHA-1 sum on the title page should really move to a 
footer on subsequent pages.  Specifically I think the footer on subsequest
pages should have:

o latex document name (like filexfer.tex)
o git branch and such
o 7-characters of SHA-1
o Created by user on date
o Updated by user on date
o ??? pages

Solid progress. Still need to merge orginal creation data.
