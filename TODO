+++ Tue Jun 28 09:12:16 AKDT 2016 - The title page and header/footer still
needs more work.

o The 7-characters of SHA-1 sum on the title page should really move to a 
footer on subsequent pages.  Specifically I think the footer on subsequest
pages should have:

o latex document name (like filexfer.tex)
o git branch and such
o 7-characters of SHA-1
o Created by user on date
o Updated by user on date
o ??? pages
